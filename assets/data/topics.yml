          High Available Database Architecture is so important.  It is more than
          just the HA but also scalable design to the demand.   MySQL Group
          Replication is one of the key features in MySQL 5.7 (since the
          release of 5.7.17).   The session will share the setup of MySQL Group
          Replication together with the MySQL InnoDB Cluster, in which the MySQL
          Shell, MySQL Router + MySQL Group Replication architecture go together
          to form a scalable and reliable db infrastructure to your
          application(s).

          Whilst anyone can inspect the source code of free software for
          malicious flaws, most Linux distributions provide binary
          (or "compiled") packages to end users.

        - >
          The motivation behind "reproducible" builds is to allow verification
          that no flaws have been introduced during this compilation process by
          promising identical binary packages are always generated from a
          given source.

        - >
          This prevents against the installation of backdoor-introducing malware
          on developers' machines - an attacker would need to simultaneously
          infect or blackmail all developers attempting to reproduce the build.

        - >
          This talk will focus heavily on how exactly software can fail to be
          reproducible, the tools, tests & specifications we have written to
          fix & diagnose issues, as well as the many amusing "fails" in
          upstream's code that have been unearthed by this process. In addition,
          you will learn what to avoid in your own software as well as the
          future efforts in the Reproducible Builds arena.

          Rust is great for building mathematical models and AI which is the
          talk of the hour and a great emerging domain is based on mathematics
          which can crunch realtime data to provide human level insights which
          helps in making logical decisions.
        - >
          There are already many crates in rust which provide AI units which
          help in implementing deep learning and reinforcement learning systems
          and algorithms.

          covers the benchmarks of performance of the rust crates with the
          industrial grade libraries such as tensor flow and caffe. The Talk
          touches upon the major problems in the industrial grade libraries and
          how rust can help in avoiding them.

          ODF instead of OOXML, which has a lot more users in the world?
          What's the differences?  What's the advantages using a stable and
          open spec file format?  LibreOffice v.s. Microsoft Office -- It's not
          a war of software.  It's actually a war of file format.

          Studying satisfaction with life can assist evaluation of the effect
          of interventions mediating mental disorders, yet frequent or regular
          monitoring of SWL in longitudinal studies is laborious and often
          results in high dropout rate. In this study, we applied machine
          learning to social network data to predict SWL. Based on a variety of
          feature selection methods and a three-step random forest model, our
          language-based model for SWL reached an accuracy of 0.58
          (SWL split into three classes). Machine-predicted SWL scores showed
          higher validity coefficients than self-reported SWL scores when
          predicting certain life outcomes. Using the same method, we built
          three more models predicting respectively depression, personality,
          and self-disclosure, the accuracies of which were all over 0.50.
          Comparison of these models suggest that content words such as negative
          emotion words are the major indicators of SWL and a multi-step random
          forest model can make valid predictions for many psychological traits.

          翻譯軟體訊息與翻譯一般文件的需求差異，是造成本地化工作困難的原因之一。本工具希望能
          夠扮演前置翻譯程式的角色，藉由字典檔案的比對，減輕翻譯者保持字彙一致的壓力，而能專
          注於語意的正確與敘述的通順。除了由英語翻譯為漢語的功能之外，在不同的漢語翻譯之間互
          轉也是程式的設計目標。

          We use ZMQ as RPC transport between golang coroutine and python
          thread in web server. The problem is handling one web request will
          trigger multiple RPC calls between golang and python. The original
          implementation of the RPC does not bidirectional and multiplexing
          transport. As result, the call between golang and python will easily
          consumed all python thread in thread pool very easily. We implement
          a bidirectional and multiplexing transport, so we can reduce overhead
          and reuse blocked workers.

          This talk would be covering a quick recap of why we need penetration
          testing, what metasploit framework is, and how to use it for
          penetration testing. The talk would be including a mimic penetration
          testing scenario as a showcase for how the framework is used.
          Participant would expect after some introductory slides, live demo
          (mainly command line interface) would take place. Though it is not
          necessary, it is encouraged that participant would bring their own
          laptop to follow the demo if they wish to.

          Excel formulas can be quite slow when you're processing data files
          with thousands of rows. It's also especially difficult to maintain
          the files when you have some messy mixture of VLOOKUPs, Pivot Tables,
          Macros and VBAs.
        - >
          In this interactive workshop targeted for non-coders, we will make
          use of SQLite, a very lightweight and portable open source database
          library, to perform some simple and repeatable data analysis on large
          datasets that are publicly available. We will also explore what you
          can further do with the data by using some powerful extensions of
          SQLite.
        - >
          While SQLite may not totally replace Excel in many ways, after the
          workshop you will find that it can improve your work efficiency and
          make your life much easier in so many use cases!

          When Linus Torvalds set down to write git it was Bash that he first
          wrote it in. In this lecture, I'll explore the reasons why many
          developers still use this scripting language to play with ideas and
          write new tools. I'll present some of the most powerful features of
          the language, and will help you getting started with it.
