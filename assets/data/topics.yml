  -   title:    Applying serverless architecture pattern to distributed data processing

          Serverless architectures refer to applications that significantly depend on "cloud"
          services (knows as Backend as a Service) or on custom code that's run in ephemeral runtime
          (Function as a Service or "FaaS").
        - >
          To application developers "serverless" mean app where some certain logic of it is still
          written by the developer but unlike traditional architectures or microservices is run
          in stateless compute runtime that are event-triggered, may only last for one invocation,
          and fully managed by a cloud.
          Serverless helps developers to transfer responsibility of  keeping their apps up and
          running as well as scaling out their workload capacity without involving devops/ops
          as we got used to.
        - >
          In this talk we will go through whole "serverless" thing: from decomposing
          app and its logic to microservices and further to smaller bits, i.e.
          functions to defining data flow through functions and building their fault-tolerant pipeline.
        - >
          <h3>Moreover, we will go through demo that highlight key takeaways:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>what is functions, what it could and could not be</li>
            <li>how design scalable architecture without getting into troubles by hitting concrete bottlenecks</li>
            <li>how combine multiple programming languages into a single app</li>
            <li>why Python is one of the best programming languages designed exactly for serverless</li>
          </ul>

          Gradient boosting machines (GBM) and related tree-based algorithms have
          been proved to be highly effective and accurate in a wide range of machine
          learning tasks. It is also one of the most popular algorithms among
          participants in Kaggle competitions. This talk will introduce the basic
          concepts of gradient boosting machines, the commonly used libraries in
          Python such as XGBoost and LightGBM for performing machine learning
          using GBM, and ways to tune the hyper-parameters of a model to avoid
          over/under-fitting and achieve better results. The audience are expected
          to have basic understanding of machine learning. Codes and slides will
          be provided on Github after the talk.

          This topic covers 4 years journey of JSON-RPC library implementation. While
          there were several similar projects, the author decided to write another one.
          Why reinvent the wheel?
        - >
          Now the library is the most popular Python implementation of JSON-RPC protocol.
          Kirill wants to share his ideas behind package architecture, positioning,
          and promotion.

          The workshop aims to discuss the methods and best practices in data
          visualization by Python + Matplotlib 2, by providing a hands-on experience.
          Topics include plots commonly used in scientific communication and finance,
          as well as tuning figure aesthetics in the designer's perspective.
          Some examples will be taken from the book "Matplotlib 2 By Example",
          which the speaker has co-authored.

          We all know Python is slow. But in many cases it is not. Before blindly
          complaining the slowness of Python, we need to know when it is slow.
          There are also many cases it's totally OK to be slow, so before optimizing
          the code, we need know to when it's worth our time to rewrite our code. I will
          talk about Python's performance in different fields such as scientific computing,
          machine learning, plotting, network programming...etc. And also mention some
          experience about profiling and accelerating the code.

          The project is in HKU deep learning lab. We analyze a large set of energy
          consumption data and build real time application based on the prediction.
          The topic involves different machine learning approaches and comparison.
          Since the machine learning is often discussed, I will also talk about the
          often ignored skill in data science. How to handle huge data and optimize
          the processing code, how to effectively build useful tools and make the life
          of data scientist easier, and how to correctly interpret the predicting result
          to enhance the project level from merely "machine learning" to real
          "data-driven application"

          It is often required to manipulate the data as fast as possible, be it
          either column average calculation or simple join and filtering. Servers
          often do not have convenient tools, such as Python (numpy/pandas) of R,
          moreover, the data might not fit into memory. This talk shows how to
          make fast but inconvenient command line tools great again. This is based
          on work done in Yandex and allows to process Gbs of data with one-liner commands.
