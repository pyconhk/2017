      id:       applying-serverless-architecture-pattern-to-distributed-data-processing

          Serverless architectures refer to applications that significantly depend on "cloud" 
          services (knows as Backend as a Service) or on custom code that's run in ephemeral runtime 
          (Function as a Service or "FaaS").
        - >
          To application developers "serverless" mean app where some certain logic of it is still 
          written by the developer but unlike traditional architectures or microservices is run 
          in stateless compute runtime that are event-triggered, may only last for one invocation, 
          and fully managed by a cloud.
          Serverless helps developers to transfer responsibility of  keeping their apps up and 
          running as well as scaling out their workload capacity without involving devops/ops 
          as we got used to.
        - >  
          In this talk we will go through whole "serverless" thing: from decomposing 
          app and its logic to microservices and further to smaller bits, i.e. 
          functions to defining data flow through functions and building their fault-tolerant pipeline. 
        - >  
          <h3>Moreover, we will go through demo that highlight key takeaways:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>what is functions, what it could and could not be</li>
            <li>how design scalable architecture without getting into troubles by hitting concrete bottlenecks</li>
            <li>how combine multiple programming languages into a single app</li>
            <li>why Python is one of the best programming languages designed exactly for serverless</li>

          Gradient boosting machines (GBM) and related tree-based algorithms have 
          been proved to be highly effective and accurate in a wide range of machine 
          learning tasks. It is also one of the most popular algorithms among 
          participants in Kaggle competitions. This talk will introduce the basic 
          concepts of gradient boosting machines, the commonly used libraries in 
          Python such as XGBoost and LightGBM for performing machine learning 
          using GBM, and ways to tune the hyper-parameters of a model to avoid
          over/under-fitting and achieve better results. The audience are expected 
          to have basic understanding of machine learning. Codes and slides will 
          be provided on Github after the talk.

                Reproducible builds: Fulfilling the original promise of free software

          Whilst anyone can inspect the source code of free software for
          malicious flaws, most Linux distributions provide binary
          (or "compiled") packages to end users.
        - >
          The motivation behind "reproducible" builds is to allow verification
          that no flaws have been introduced during this compilation process by
          promising identical binary packages are always generated from a
          given source.
        - >
          This prevents against the installation of backdoor-introducing malware
          on developers' machines - an attacker would need to simultaneously
          infect or blackmail all developers attempting to reproduce the build.
        - >
          This talk will focus heavily on how exactly software can fail to be
          reproducible, the tools, tests & specifications we have written to
          fix & diagnose issues, as well as the many amusing "fails" in
          upstream's code that have been unearthed by this process. In addition,
          you will learn what to avoid in your own software as well as the
          future efforts in the Reproducible Builds arena.

          contributing to the Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), there are
          lots of jobs available for the people with FOSS background. As a paid,
          full-time FOSS contributor Vaishali Thakkar has built her career
          around by contributing in one of the biggest open source project
          Linux Kernel. In this talk, she aims to talk about giving an
          overview of valuable ways to contribute and how they relate to
          building a career in FOSS. She will also focus on some of the
          benefits of working in open source communities which are beyond money,
          including [but not limited to] how it leads to opportunities to travel,
          collaborate with different people around the world and satisfaction of
          working on big and interesting FOSS projects.

          Studying satisfaction with life can assist evaluation of the effect
          of interventions mediating mental disorders, yet frequent or regular
          monitoring of SWL in longitudinal studies is laborious and often
          results in high dropout rate. In this study, we applied machine
          learning to social network data to predict SWL. Based on a variety of
          feature selection methods and a three-step random forest model, our
          language-based model for SWL reached an accuracy of 0.58
          (SWL split into three classes). Machine-predicted SWL scores showed
          higher validity coefficients than self-reported SWL scores when
          predicting certain life outcomes. Using the same method, we built
          three more models predicting respectively depression, personality,
          and self-disclosure, the accuracies of which were all over 0.50.
          Comparison of these models suggest that content words such as negative
          emotion words are the major indicators of SWL and a multi-step random
          forest model can make valid predictions for many psychological traits.

          It is known for its Plasma Desktop, a desktop environment provided as the default working environment on many Linux distributions, such as Kubuntu The goal of the community is to provide basic desktop functions and applications for daily needs as well as tools and documentation for developers to write stand-alone applications for the system.
          In this regard, the KDE project serves as an umbrella project for many standalone applications and smaller projects that are based on KDE technology.
          The talk involves my journey as a SoK student in 2012 where I worked with KDE under kde educational game pairs, then as a Google Summer of Code student in 2013 with plasma team, emerging as a Google Code In 2013 mentor as well as administrator of Season of KDE 2014 as well as Google Code In 2014 for KDE organization.

             Visualizations act as a campfire around which we gather to tell stories (AI Shalloway, 2011).
             Most sophisticated visualization tools supports visual encodings and analysis routines but lacks
             interactivity to support narrative communication. Hence, it diminishes the expressiveness,i.e, the
             diversity of possible visualizations and leads to substantial runtime overhead. It remains an open
             question that how these tools be upgraded to support optimal and wide range of storytelling.
             This talk deals with the amalgamation of narrative storytelling with interactive and responsive
             visualizations through advanced filtering.
          - >
            According to Ben Shneiderman(2003), a picture is worth a thousand words. An interface is worth a
            thousand pictures. Hence, with the rise in visualization techniques, the need to catalogue and
            consolidate it arises as well. In recent years, static visualizations via diagrams and charts are
            used for author driven financial storytelling in which the text provides the outline and the image
            depicts the related details.
            Prior to that, conventional raw dataset was used to provide details to the subject. Though it
            clarifies the visual elements but produces clutter.According to a recent survey, less than 25% of
            the individuals over the age of 50 were not aware of fundamental economic concepts such as exposure,
            inflation and hence failed to invest properly. It refers to the need of proper financial planning
            which is inculcated with the use of narrative communication through visualization techniques with
            runtime filtering so that the visualization could be manipulated by the users. Through prior
            research work on drill down stories, the author observed the need for single frame interactivity
            and consistent visual platform for reader driven stories.
          - >
            Thereby, enabling the end users to foster the decision making by visualizing aggregated risk and other factors efficiently. This talk thus
            investigates a problem statement to visualize reader driven top performers involving exposure and
            profit allocation across a varied set of dimensions such as funds, segment and sector to illustrate
            design space using graphical techniques and interactivity enforcing a narrative flow. Later, the talk
            also illustrates  a narrative exploratory analysis of high dimensional datasets using brushing technique.

            After a brief introduction of MySQL PaaS service, we will introduce
            the integration with .NET Core stack. MySQL's traditional technology
            stack is a complete ORM framework based on Linux's LNMP/LAMP and
            Java. With .NET Core advantages on both open source and cross
            platform, how can the.NET stack such as ORM (Entity Framework) be
            better supported with MySQL? With two domestic open source projects
            mysqlconnector Ado.net provider) and Pomelo (EF MySQL Provider),
            we could enjoy the convenience of the full support on MySQL with
            .NET Core.

          High Available Database Architecture is so important.  It is more than
          just the HA but also scalable design to the demand.   MySQL Group
          Replication is one of the key features in MySQL 5.7 (since the
          release of 5.7.17).   The session will share the setup of MySQL Group
          Replication together with the MySQL InnoDB Cluster, in which the MySQL
          Shell, MySQL Router + MySQL Group Replication architecture go together
          to form a scalable and reliable db infrastructure to your
          application(s).

            As long as you are the application developers, you need a DB.  As
            long as you care about your data, you need a reliable DB.
