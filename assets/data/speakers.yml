      Hi! I am Benny.
      I am 20 year-old and now studying at the University of Hong Kong.
      I love coding and I enjoy coding in Python.
    - >
      I am currently a year-2 student who would like to learn not only how to
      code, but also why the code works and how to make the code better.
      Hence I choose a major that would give me more understanding on hardware
      and lower level implementation. And of course, more fun!
